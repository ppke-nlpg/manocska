# light_verb_exceptions.txt
This list contains 105 particle verbs which have one common trait: if the base verb is used without a particle, it is a light verb (a verb having very little semantic content of its own, so it is close to an auxiliary). However, combined with a verbal particle, a verb with an own semantic content can be formed.
Thus, the list enumerates exceptions to verbs that are basically light verbs.
The list has a very simple structure: every line contains a particle verb (a + sign marks the boundary between the particle and the verb stem). It was created using the _Hungarian Gigaword Corpus_, version 2.0.4.
