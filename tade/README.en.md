# Tádé
[Frequency list of Hungarian verb frames](http://hlt.bme.hu/hu/resources/tade), based on the [Hungarian Webcorpus](http://mokk.bme.hu/resources/webcorpus/).

[It can be downloaded as a Tab-separated file.](http://sandbox.mokk.bme.hu/~ndavid/tmp/tade.tsv) The columns are as follows:

- verb (finite_infinitive, if the finite verb can have an infinitival argument – in this case, the argument frame belongs to the infinitive verb)
- argument frame
- the amount of the verb's occurrences with the given frame (verb-frame frequency)
- the (overall) frequency of the verb
- the proportion of the two above mentioned frequencies
